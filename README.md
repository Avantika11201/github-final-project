# Simple Interest Calculator

This is a simple interest calculator. It calculates the simple interest given the principal amount, the annual rate of interest, and the time period in years.

## Input

- `p`: Principal amount
- `t`: Time period in years
- `r`: Annual rate of interest

## Output

- `simple_interest`: Calculated simple interest using the formula: `p * t * r`

  ## Usage

To use the calculator, input the principal amount, the time period in years, and the annual rate of interest. The calculator will then compute the simple interest.

```python
# Python example
p = 1000  # principal amount
t = 2     # time period in years
r = 0.05  # annual rate of interest

simple_interest = p * t * r
print("Simple Interest:", simple_interest)
